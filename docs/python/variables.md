## Variable Names:
- Must start with a letter or an underscore
- Can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
- Case sensitive (Angle is _not_ the same as angle)

## A Variety of Values can be Assigned to Variables
- Use an equal sign `=` to assign a value to a variable
- The variable ALWAYS appears to the left of the equal sign
- Some valid examples: 
    - Text: angle = "Ninety degrees"
    - A number with a decimal point: angle = 90.0
    - A number without a decimal point: angle = 90
    - A collection: angle = ["Ninety", 90.0, 90]
