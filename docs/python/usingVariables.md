In the simple square program we repeated the numbers for the distance and turning angle four times in four different places.  If we wanted to change the size of our box we would have to change the code in four different places.  By using variables we can make our program easier to change.

Modifying the previous example program, we will still make the turtle go forward 40 steps and then make a right turn of 90 degrees.  However, we will use variables to make our life easier.  Note the inclusion of a set of comments before the code, identifying the author, when the code was created, and any changes to the code

!!! Experiments
    Can you make the turtle draw a larger square? 

    - Hint: Set the the value of the distance variable
